This is a small webapp that allows the user to input a spreadsheet file and then graphs that data. The user has many options for customizing the graphs.


#### After Making Changes
The command `npm run compile` will use webpack to create the `dist/bundle.js` file.

#### Technologies and Libraries Utilized

The first decision was to use React. I have a lot of experience with AngularJS but I'd like to get more experience with React. Likely with Babel so I can use JSX and webpack for building. I'll use the CSS preprocessor SASS. And likely the postprocessor Autoprefixer. On the server side of things I'll be using Node.js, with Express.js.
